# websrv

`websrv` is a Linux-only, QUIC-first Rust web server. Its runtime is **Monoio's `IoUringDriver`**, selected explicitly at startup. HTTP/3 over QUIC/UDP is the primary protocol and is implemented with `quiche`. HTTPS over TCP independently enables HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 through TLS ALPN; cleartext HTTP/1.1 and prior-knowledge HTTP/2 (h2c) share a configurable TCP listener. All TCP/UDP request-time networking and static content reads use the same mandatory Monoio `IoUringDriver`. Every protocol shares virtual-host routing, static sites, and in-process Rust REST controllers. TCP responses advertise the QUIC endpoint through `Alt-Svc` so compatible clients can upgrade to HTTP/3.

**There is no Tokio dependency, no epoll/legacy driver feature, and no request-time I/O backend fallback.** If `io_uring_setup` is unavailable or denied by a container seccomp policy, startup fails instead of silently changing drivers. Request-time UDP/TCP socket operations and static-content reads are driven by Monoio’s mandatory `IoUringDriver`. Configuration parsing, path canonicalization, and initial TLS PEM loading are bootstrap operations performed before traffic is accepted. `http1_secure_enabled: true` enables HTTPS HTTP/1.1 on the secure TCP listener; `http2_secure_enabled: true` independently enables HTTP/2 there. ALPN selects an enabled secure protocol. `http1_plain_enabled: true` enables cleartext HTTP/1.1 on `plain_listen`; `http2_plain_enabled: true` enables cleartext HTTP/2 prior-knowledge on the same listener (default `0.0.0.0:8080`). All listeners use Monoio's mandatory io_uring driver; disable individual protocol flags to disable them. Cleartext HTTP/2 supports prior-knowledge h2c, not the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade mechanism.

- **Runtime:** `monoio` is built with `default-features = false` and the `iouring` + `utils` features; `utils` provides runtime utilities and does not enable a legacy I/O driver. The code constructs `RuntimeBuilder<IoUringDriver>` explicitly. Monoio is a thread-per-core runtime built around io_uring rather than a Tokio compatibility layer. See [Monoio's runtime documentation](https://docs.rs/monoio/latest/monoio/).
- **QUIC/HTTP/3:** `quiche` owns QUIC, TLS handshake, loss recovery, congestion control, HTTP/3 framing, and QPACK. Its API leaves UDP socket driving and the event loop to the application; websrv drives those on Monoio. See [quiche HTTP/3 documentation](https://docs.rs/quiche/latest/quiche/h3/).
- **HTTPS protocol negotiation:** `src/http1_server.rs` terminates TLS with rustls and negotiates `h2` or `http/1.1` through ALPN. HTTP/2 uses `monoio-http` and `monoio-rustls`; HTTP/1.1 keeps its bounded parser. Both are driven by the mandatory Monoio `IoUringDriver`, and both dispatch into the same host/static/controller runtime. HTTP/1.1 accepts `Content-Length` request bodies, rejects `Transfer-Encoding` and `Expect`, bounds headers and bodies, and supports persistent connections.
- **HTTP/2 streams:** `src/http2_server.rs` accepts multiplexed request streams and routes each request to the shared dispatcher. Request bodies are bounded; response payloads are sent in flow-control-aware chunks rather than buffered without limit in the HTTP/2 library.
- **Virtual hosting:** exact names are checked before wildcard names; aliases are supported. Each host has exactly one serving target: a static root or a named Rust controller table.
- **Controller model:** controller routes are declared in YAML and map to Rust handler modules. No shell process, CGI, FastCGI daemon, or arbitrary configured executable is launched. Add business logic under `src/controllers/` and register its route handler explicitly.
- **File reads:** static content is opened and read asynchronously using Monoio's file API. Static content roots should be owned by the publisher and not writable by the websrv runtime user. Do not place untrusted symlinks under a served root.
- **Startup-only operations:** config parsing, TLS key loading, root canonicalization, and tracing initialization happen during bootstrap before serving traffic. Request-time UDP and TCP socket I/O plus static file reads use the mandatory io_uring runtime.

## Requirements

- Linux with a kernel and configuration that permit `io_uring` (typically Linux 5.6+; a newer maintained kernel is recommended).
- A container/runtime seccomp policy that permits `io_uring_setup`, `io_uring_enter`, and the required registration calls.
- Rust stable and Cargo. The `quiche` build may need a C/C++ toolchain, CMake, Clang, Perl, and pkg-config to build its TLS dependency.
- A trusted certificate chain and matching private key in PEM format, covering every hostname you serve. The same certificate/key pair is used by QUIC and HTTPS (HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1).
- UDP ingress for HTTP/3 and TCP ingress for HTTPS/HTTP/2 and HTTPS/1.1 on `0.0.0.0:8443`, plus configurable plain HTTP/1.1 and prior-knowledge HTTP/2 TCP on `0.0.0.0:8080` in the bundled config.

## Build and run

```bash
mkdir -p certs
# Install a trusted certificate chain at certs/fullchain.pem and its key at certs/privkey.pem.
# Edit virtual_hosts and controllers in config.yaml.
cargo fmt --all
cargo test
cargo build --release
./target/release/websrv --config ./config.yaml
```

The default config path is `config.yaml` in the current working directory. Use `-c` or `--config` to specify another file. Relative certificate and static-root paths are resolved against the directory containing the YAML file. Environment variables do not override YAML settings and `.env` files are not loaded.

### Local HTTP/3 smoke test

The hostname in the `Host`/`:authority` header must match a configured virtual host. For local-only testing, create a development certificate with SANs for `example.test`, `api.example.test`, and any tenant names. Use a curl build that supports HTTP/3 for the primary protocol:

```bash
curl --http3-only --resolve example.test:8443:127.0.0.1 \
  --cacert certs/fullchain.pem https://example.test:8443/

curl --http3-only --resolve api.example.test:8443:127.0.0.1 \
  --cacert certs/fullchain.pem https://api.example.test:8443/healthz
```

The secure TCP listener shares the same certificate and hostname routing. To explicitly verify secure HTTP/1.1, use a curl build supporting standard TLS:

```bash
curl --http1.1 --resolve example.test:8443:127.0.0.1 \
  --cacert certs/fullchain.pem https://example.test:8443/

curl --http1.1 --resolve api.example.test:8443:127.0.0.1 \
  --cacert certs/fullchain.pem https://api.example.test:8443/healthz
```

### Local HTTPS/HTTP/2 smoke test

HTTP/2 is negotiated with TLS ALPN on TCP port 8443. Use a curl build compiled with HTTP/2 support; `--write-out` reports the negotiated protocol version:

```bash
curl --http2 --resolve example.test:8443:127.0.0.1 \
  --cacert certs/fullchain.pem \
  --write-out '\nHTTP version: %{http_version}\n' https://example.test:8443/

curl --http2 --resolve api.example.test:8443:127.0.0.1 \
  --cacert certs/fullchain.pem \
  --write-out '\nHTTP version: %{http_version}\n' https://api.example.test:8443/healthz
```

The reported HTTP version should be `2`. The `http2_secure_enabled` flag controls only secure HTTP/2; secure HTTP/1.1 is independently controlled by `http1_secure_enabled`.

### Local cleartext HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 prior-knowledge smoke test

The bundled config enables plain HTTP/1.1 and prior-knowledge HTTP/2 on TCP port 8080. Use the `Host` header (or `--resolve`) to exercise the same virtual-host routing without TLS:

```bash
curl --http1.1 --resolve example.test:8080:127.0.0.1 http://example.test:8080/
curl --http1.1 --resolve api.example.test:8080:127.0.0.1 http://api.example.test:8080/healthz
```

### Local cleartext HTTP/2 prior-knowledge (h2c) smoke test

When `http2_plain_enabled` is true, clients can connect directly using the HTTP/2 connection preface. This listener supports prior-knowledge h2c, not the HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade: h2c` mechanism.

```bash
curl --http2-prior-knowledge --resolve example.test:8080:127.0.0.1 \
  --write-out '\nHTTP version: %{http_version}\n' http://example.test:8080/

curl --http2-prior-knowledge --resolve api.example.test:8080:127.0.0.1 \
  --write-out '\nHTTP version: %{http_version}\n' http://api.example.test:8080/healthz
```

Both cleartext protocols share `plain_listen`; the server detects the HTTP/2 connection preface without losing bytes and routes all remaining requests to the same virtual-host dispatcher.

For a trusted local development CA, add the CA certificate to `--cacert`; do not expose development certificates to public traffic.

Unknown YAML keys are rejected. A virtual host must configure exactly one of `static` or `controller`. Static path traversal attempts and encoded `..` segments are rejected. Keep served roots immutable to the server process; this project assumes trusted deployment content and does not claim a defense against a privileged local writer racing filesystem changes.

### Timeout, overload and metrics protection

The shared admission layer applies global, per-peer-IP, per-host, static-site, and controller in-flight limits. Per-IP token-bucket throttling returns `429`; the server-wide token bucket and capacity exhaustion return `503`. Request bodies and headers are byte-bounded, TCP and QUIC connections have global/per-IP caps, and per-IP tracking is bounded with inactive entries expired. Configure these thresholds for available memory and expected traffic before public deployment.

`timeouts` places explicit deadlines around TLS handshakes, HTTP/1.1 header/body reception, controller/static dispatch, response writes, and keep-alive waits. HTTP/3 has per-stream header/body/process/write handling; expired incomplete request-header streams are reset. The current `monoio-http` HTTP/2 adapter exposes completed requests rather than per-stream incomplete-header progress, so slow/incomplete HTTP/2 header parsing is bounded by its connection-level accept/idle timeout instead of a separate per-stream timer. An idle accept timeout will not close an HTTP/2 connection while already accepted request streams are still being processed. Timeout cancellation drops the request future; custom controller handlers must not detach unbounded background work and should cooperate with deadlines for CPU-heavy processing.

Expose `GET /metrics` on a controller host to inspect in-flight counts and cumulative rejections, rate limiting, timeouts, and client aborts. IP-based limits use the transport peer address, not untrusted forwarding headers. These application controls mitigate abusive request patterns but do not replace upstream DDoS filtering for volumetric network saturation.

## Built-in REST handlers

The example controller registry includes:

- `health`: JSON health response.
- `status`: build/runtime feature status.
- `metrics`: in-memory admission, timeout, rejection, and abort counters (configure `/metrics`).
- `echo`: JSON/text request echo with the configured request-body cap.
- `items`: demonstration CRUD handler backed by an in-memory map (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`). This data is **not persistent** and is intended as a controller integration example, not a database replacement.

Controllers live in `src/controllers/`. The dispatcher receives a parsed HTTP/3, HTTP/2, or HTTP/1.1 request, matches method and route parameters, and invokes Rust functions as Monoio tasks. To add an application module, implement the handler, add its route name to the explicit registry and configuration validation, then declare routes under `controllers`.

## Docker and systemd

Docker image builds include a C toolchain for quiche and declare **UDP 8443, TCP 8443 (HTTP/2/HTTPS/1.1), and TCP 8080** (the latter when cleartext HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 prior-knowledge is enabled). Publish only the ports you intend to expose. Mount a certificate and key at `/run/secrets/tls_cert` and `/run/secrets/tls_key`, and make sure the container runtime's seccomp policy permits io_uring. Do not use `--privileged` as a workaround; use an explicit, reviewed seccomp profile.

The systemd unit runs as an unprivileged `websrv` user. Install it and the binary under `/opt/websrv`, edit `/opt/websrv/config.yaml`, and ensure the service user can read the private key and static roots. The bundled config also listens for cleartext HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 prior-knowledge on TCP port 8080; firewall that port only if intended for public access.

## Security and production readiness

- Use valid TLS certificates and automate rotation; the server does not generate certificates. The configured certificate and private key are shared by QUIC and TCP TLS and must cover every configured hostname.
- Expose UDP for HTTP/3, TCP for secure HTTP when either `http1_secure_enabled` or `http2_secure_enabled` is true, and TCP on `plain_listen` when either `http1_plain_enabled` or `http2_plain_enabled` is true. Every listener uses the mandatory io_uring runtime. Plain HTTP is unencrypted; use it only when appropriate (for example, behind a trusted TLS-terminating proxy or for an intentional HTTP endpoint).
- Keep private keys readable only by the service account.
- Do not allow the serving account to modify website roots; avoid symlinks inside served roots.
- Configure edge rate limiting / DDoS protection and observe structured logs before exposing a public endpoint. Active connection migration is disabled in this version; connections are keyed by destination connection ID to allow multiple connections from one client UDP socket without conflation.
- Audit controller handlers before enabling mutating API routes. The sample item store is in-memory and has no authentication or authorization built in.
- Set resource limits, benchmark under representative traffic, and test overload behavior before production deployment.

## Validation status

This source tree has not been compiled or load-tested in the current environment because Rust/Cargo are not installed here. The CI workflow runs formatting, `cargo check`, tests, and Clippy on Linux; passing those checks plus HTTP/3, HTTP/2, and HTTP/1.1 interoperability tests remains a release gate.
